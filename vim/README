This is my vim settings, most of which is none of my doing (plugins wise)

On unix based systems I advise doing the following: 
(Not that anyone will probably ever read or use my vim settings)

# Move to your home directory
cd ~ 
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:yoda/vim.git
# Make symbolic links to the directory and the vimrc
ln -s ~/vim/ .vim
ln -s ~/vim/vimrc .vimrc
# Now vim should be happy

For the slime plugin

screen -S session01
<Ctrl>-a <Shift>-a window01
run shell (irb, mysql, etc...)

The magic key is <Ctrl>-c <Ctrl>-c
The first time, you'll be prompted for the "session name" and the "window name"
Subsequent times will be automated
You can reprompt for "session name" and "window name" with <Ctrl>-c v
By default, <Ctrl>-c <Ctrl>-c will select the current paragraph and copy-paste it
But you can make your own selection first, and send it over with <Ctrl>-c <Ctrl>-c
