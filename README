This is my vim settings, most of which is none of my doing (plugins wise)

On unix based systems I advise doing the following: 
(Not that anyone will probably ever read or use my vim settings)

# Move to your home directory
cd ~ 
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:yoda/vim.git
# Make symbolic links to the directory and the vimrc
ln -s ~/vim/ .vim
ln -s ~/vim/vimrc .vimrc
# Now vim should be happy
